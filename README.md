>WARNING: THIS LIBRARY HAS NOT BEEN TESTED ENOUGH TO BE CONSIDERED PRODUCTION-READY YET (HENCE THE ALPHA VERSION DESIGNATION). USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. MEANWHILE, YOU ARE WELCOME TO SEND ME COMMENTS, SUGGESTIONS AND BUG REPORTS.

## Description
The **AirBag** library allows the pixel-precise detection of collisions amongst a list of DisplayObjects (MovieClips, Sprites, Bitmaps, TextFields, Videos, etc.). It supports the exclusion of color ranges as well as a user-definable alpha threshold below which collisions wonâ€™t be triggered.
